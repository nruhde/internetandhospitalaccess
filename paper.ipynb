    "# H1 Title: How Useful Will Telemedicine Be?: Examining Hospital and Internet Access in Cook County\n",
    "# H1 Abstract:\n",
    "Telemedicine has become much more prominent in the recent past. However, little literature has been dedicated to understanding the spatial patterns in the Internet access necessary to have quality telehealth visits. This piece fills such a gap. This paper will detail the creation of an interactive dashboard using internet data from the American Community Survey and provider data from the NPI Registry maintained by Center for Medicaid Services. The dashboard shows that (in Cook County) significant clustering exists in lack of Internet connection (p<.01), no relationship exists between internet access and provider access (p=.81), with unclear evidence regarding the clustering patterns of providers. These findings show the need for additional internet connection in Cook County and suggest that future research would be useful for maintaining data quality on where hospitals exist in the county.\n"

    "# H2 Introduction: \n",
    "    Since the onset of the pandemic, telemedicine use has proliferated. Telemedicine became one of the core tools to deliver medicine during that time (Colbert et al., 2020). Levels of telemedicine use persistently outpace pre-pandemic levels in multiple countries throughout the world (Mehrotra et al., 2021). Telemedicine appears more important now than ever, and it is not going away.\n",
    "\tHowever, internet access proves to be a barrier to the widespread diffusion and use of telemedicine in the United States (Quinton et al., 2021). Those without access to the internet have been shown to be less likely to use online medical records/online health portals (Trivedi et al., 2021; Bush et al., 2018). Rural households, which often get left behind in the race to connect to the Internet (Bell et al., 2023), also tend to be the ones that do not have any health insurance (Curtis et al.,2022 ). So, even though the innovation that has come as the result of the Internet should be lauded, it has highlighted socioeconomic disparities in access to care in new ways.\n",
    "\tDespite the issues with internet access, the definition of Medically Underserved Areas has not evolved. As long as the Internet is not deemed a “health care service,” (Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 2023), this issue will continue to be neglected. Studying the distribution of Internet access in households vis a vis the distribution of hospitals can provide valuable insights regarding what areas might benefit most from telemedicine services and which communities might be left behind by both sets of opportunities. Because dashboards are interactive tools, they serve as a unique tool that could help healthcare providers, policy makers, insurance companies, and the lay public alike understand the relationships between these two variables.\n"

    "# H2 Data and preprocessing: \n",
    "    Internet data were gathered from NHGIS (Manson et al., 2023). Internet access data were based on the American Community Survey in 2021. The data were joined between the shape file and the csv file. The original csv file contained more columns than I needed for this project. So, I filtered down the number of columns with which I was dealing to make sure that I could handle all of the data appropriately. I used GISJOIN to allow the shape and csv files to join, the state and county fields to filter appropriately, GEO_ID, which is unique for each ID, AOU2E001, which is the total number of people who responded to the survey, and AOU2E013, which is the number of people who responded to the survey who said that they had no Internet.  Data were then filtered down to Cook County census tracts only, and saved internally on my machine. With the file saved on my computer, I could minimize the amount of memory that my computer uses in the process of dealing with the file. I made a field entitled 'normal,' which shows the percentage of total folks who do not have Internet in a given census tract. The code to do this is below. "

    "To understand the relationship between internet and providers, I tried three different combinations of maps and tests: internet only, providers only, and combined. This way, I could have the strength of showing as much or as little data as I wanted in any given situation, which would especially be helpful if I wanted to show tihs to an outsider who may not know a lot of context about mapping or the issue at hand. however, in order to make these tests, I had to continue to prepare the data. \n",
    "    I started by trying to get the internet and the address of provider data in the same dataset so I could compare internet vs. providers in the same maps and tests. To start, I performed a spatial join on the internet and address data. Next, I grouped by and summarized the number of roviders in each census tract. Once I slimmed down the number of columns in my dataset, I was almost good to go at that point. However, one thing I noticed was that, at first, it seemed like the map and the regression told two different stories. After exploring the data further, I realized that, when I spatially joined the data, it created an observation for each of the providers. While that is helpful for getting point level geometry for the plots, it could screw up any future statistical tests because it would improerly weight certain observations over others. To mitigate this, i concluded by dropping all duplicates. Here is the code for that:\n",
    "To test whether or not clustering exists between all of the internet data, I used spatial autocorrelatoin and the following hypotheses:\n",
    "H0: No relationship exists in the distribution of internet access. Ha: A spatial relationship exists for internet access across Cook County.\n",

    "(To see the results of the dashboard, please check out the pictures in this folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fvsk3IXhQfkbxUHldm3a6OSscujalpkO?usp=sharing)\n",
    "#H3 Initial Visual Insights\n",
    "From the initial visuals, one can see a number of things. First, one can see that providers seem to be slightly clustered as people move in toward the city. The same can be seen in both internet maps. As people move in toward the city, they tend to have less internet. While such a pattern is obvious for both non-normalized and normalized by population graphs, this is especially obvious in the graph that is normalized by population. \n",
    "# H3 Linear Regression\n",
    "The linear regression yields a beta coefficient of 0.11, meaning that a 1 unit increase in \"normal\" (i.e. as the proportion of people in a census tract who have no internet goes from 0 to 100%), corresponds to a .11 provider increase in the community. The p value of .81 shows that a value of this magnitude or greater could be expected by chance 81% of the time. Because this value is less than .05, the relationship between the proportion of people who do not have internet and providers in the community is not statistically significant. Given that internet access has been increasingly recognized as a social determinant of health (Benda et al., 2020), the finding appears somewhat surprising. The findings suggest that applications of social determinants of health must be considered context specific and do not necessarily apply in all contexts.\n",
    "# H3 Spatial Autocorrelation\n",
    "The Moran's I for the internet access is 0.48 with a p value of .001, meaning that correlation of this magnitude or greater would happen by chance less than 1% of the time. Since this is less than .05, the null hypothesis can be rejected. Significant clustering exists amongst internet access in Cook County. Given that Cook County's Community Health Status Assessment reports disparities in internet access by part of the county, this finding is not particularly surprising (CCDPH, 2022, p. 51). The p value of the Moran's I for the healthcare providers is .022, meaning that we could expect clustering to this degree or greater by chance around 2% of the time. While this is statistically significant, it seems like a couple of outliers might have had a significant impact in this result. The legend of the provider map and the scatterplot of the Moran's I for providers suggest that a small handful of outliers might be significantly tainting this result. With additional information on the rest of the providers from more geocoding services, a more holistic picture of spatial autocorrelation amongst the providers could be gleaned.\n",
    "# H3 Strengths\n",
    "    This project has two main strengths: the granularity with which you can analyze patterns and the scope of the project. The dashboard aspect of the projects allows for users to have the freedom to receive information in whichever way they understand it best, while not compromising the quality of the data. Not only does the project have high quality data from a reputable source that collects this information on a regular basis (CMS, 2023), it also has a high quantity of data as well. As stated earlier, Cook County is the second largest county by population, so the dashboard shows that maps, spatial autocorrelation, and regressions can help synthesize a large amount of data.\n",
    "# H3 Limitations\n",
    "    This project is not perfect and, as such, has some notable limitations. These include: geocoder and lack of clarity on what types of providers exist here. Like I said earlier, the geocoder only caught roughly 70% of the providers form the initial data. Because I do not know which ones got excluded, I have no way of ensuring that the ones that got included are representative of the whole. The geocoder might have introduced some selection bias here. Also, in this study, I make no distinction between the kinds of providers that I am mapping. I partly did this just to make sure I had enough data. As discussed earlier, many census tracts did not even have any providers. That being said, though, some in the data set are individuals versus others are organizations, and they represent a wide variety of subspecialties (CMS, 2023). All of these might have varying interest in adapting telemedicine going forward. So, in order to understand the gaps necessary to fill, more context would be needed on the provider side.\n",
    "# H3 Future Directions\n",
    "    This project is not comprehensive and, as such, invites future work in a number of directions. First, Cook County, although large, is just one county in the United States. Future dashboards could be built to look at other counties or states across America with respect to internet accessibility and hospital distribution. Also, even within Cook County, more directions of investigation still exist. Given that income and education seem to be determinants of internet access on a broader scale (Chaudhuri et al., 2005), one could map income and education on to similar plots to observe potential patterns and/or effect modifiers. Finally, more formal analysis could look at LISA clusters. LISA clusters show more specifically where the clusters in any given map are and how different on each axis a given census tract is from its neighbor (Ajayakumar, 2023). While the maps communicate a lot of information quickly about the distribution of providers and internet access, LISA statistics could allow for more granular analysis. \n",
    "    Indpeendent of new research ideas, the current project could be refined by trying it with new sources of data. For example, many different geocoders exist (List of Online Geocoding Services, 2013). Future researchers could try to repeat this dashboard for Cook county while also trying to use different geocoders to see if gaps in provider data could be filled by the other services. Also, IPUMS releases new data from the American Community Survey for each year (Manson et al., 2023). Future researchers could download future iterations of American Community Survey data and provider data to see if patterns change. Also, they could download historical data, put a date slider on this dashboard, and track how the relationship between Internet access and hospitals changed over time. The potential for innovation with this dashboard remains plentiful."

    "# H2 Conclusion:\n",
    "Internet access and healthcare providers appear to be clustered in Cook County, although the clustering in internet access appears much more clear with respect to Internet access. The lack of internet access does not appear to be correlated with where healthcare providers are located in Cook County. These findings provide a unique understanding of the context with respect to access to care in Cook County, especially as it pertains to telemedicine access moving forward. These findings show the need for more internet access in certain communities, and further research could consider illuminating where clusters of poor internet access are."
